# PeopleAndPlaces

Description:
People and Places is a single-page web application that builds on your Google Contacts address book. After authenticating to Google, your contacts are pulled into the application, where you can add "tags" relevant to your contacts' interests. These tags are saved to a database and are available any time you log in to the app.  After tagging your contacts, People and Places displays a list of things to do with your friends, and a single click searches the area around your contact for activities that match their interests.
